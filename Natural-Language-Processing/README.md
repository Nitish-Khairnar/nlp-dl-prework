### Project Overview

 This project involved finding out the importance of web pages using the Google's Pagerank algorithm developed by Sergery bin and Lawrence Page who also happens to be the co founder of Google. The Pagerank algorithm is employed by Google to sort the enormous webpages on its own without the human evaluation of the content.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt about the famous Pagerank algorithm and how it work using the Vector Matrix operations. I also got to learn about the Eigen Vector Decomposition, how to find the Eigne Vectors and Eigen Values.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I had a before hand idea of matrices and Vectors, but I was new to coding with them. So I took a step by step approach how this matrix and vectors operations in python, using the Numpy and Linear Algebra functions in it.


### Challenges faced

 I had to study the Pagerank algorithm first and visualize in my mind how the works happens at back end before priotizing the web pages by Google. Although I could understand the intuition behind the Vector operations, I was facing the challenge of coding them. I took a help of various sources from the internet like Stack, my own classroom community on Slack and thus overcome this task.


### Additional pointers

 Yes, I would suggest to brush the Linear Algebra skills from Mathematics a bit, as in coding we dont get a idea what exactly the mathematical operations works in the background.
Also we must have a good idea about coding with this operations.
